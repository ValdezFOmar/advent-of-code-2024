# Advent of Code 2024

To run:

```sh
cargo run --release [days...]
```

From the original [template]:

> Each day has a `solve()` function that returns a pair of `Solution`.
> The type `Solution` is an enum that can contain any integer or a
> string.
> 
> You can create a `Solution` by specifying its type, for example
> `Solution::U32(value)`, or by using the From trait which is
> implemented for all supported types, for example
> `Solution::from(value)`.
